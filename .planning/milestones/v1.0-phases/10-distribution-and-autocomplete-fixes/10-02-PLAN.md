<objective>
Update REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table to reflect actual implementation status with individual codebase-verified evidence.

Purpose: 20 requirement statuses are stale `Pending` despite their phases being complete. The traceability table needs a 4th Evidence column with specific file/function references so anyone can verify each requirement's status.

Output: Updated REQUIREMENTS.md with accurate statuses and evidence for all 42 v1 requirements.

  <name>Task 1: Individually verify 20 stale requirements against codebase</name>
  <files>.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md</files>
  <action>
For each of the 20 stale `Pending` requirements, individually verify implementation status by examining actual codebase artifacts. Do NOT bulk-assume completion from phase status.

**Status values:** Complete, Partial, Pending (add N/A only if genuinely applicable)

**Evidence format:** File path + function/section name (not line numbers, not just phase names). Examples:
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest; 14 skills in `skills/`
- `src/lib/config.ts` `configSchema` (quality toggles)
- `skills/plan/SKILL.md` Step 5 (researcher spawn)

**Requirements to verify (20 stale Pending markers):**

1. **DIST-01** (Phase 1): Plugin manifest and namespaced skills → check `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `skills/` directory, `/mz:` namespace
2. **DIST-02** (Phase 3): ~12 slash commands available → check `commands/` directory count (should be 14 after Plan 10-01), list all skill names
3. **DIST-03** (Phase 10): npm fallback installation → check `package.json` `files` array includes `commands`, `src/cli/commands/install.ts` installFallback function, 10-01-SUMMARY.md E2E results
4. **DIST-04** (Phase 1): Plugin coexistence → check `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` `name: "mz"`, namespace isolation evidence
5. **DIST-05** (Phase 1): TypeScript CLI compiled → check `bin/megazord.mjs` exists, `package.json` `bin` entry, `tsdown.config.ts`
6. **PROJ-01** (Phase 2): `/mz:init` creates .planning/ → check `skills/init/SKILL.md` for directory creation steps
7. **PROJ-02** (Phase 3): Roadmap creation → check `skills/plan/SKILL.md` roadmap creation step
8. **PROJ-03** (Phase 3): `/mz:plan` decomposes phase → check `skills/plan/SKILL.md` task decomposition steps
9. **PROJ-04** (Phase 3): `/mz:status` shows progress → check `skills/status/SKILL.md` display sections
10. **PROJ-05** (Phase 3): `/mz:pause` context handoff → check `skills/pause/SKILL.md` stash and STATE.md update
11. **PROJ-06** (Phase 3): `/mz:resume` restores context → check `skills/resume/SKILL.md` stash restore and context loading
12. **PROJ-07** (Phase 3): `/mz:quick` bypasses ceremony → check `skills/quick/SKILL.md` inline execution
13. **PROJ-09** (Phase 11): Full lifecycle management → check roadmap/phase management works (`src/lib/roadmap.ts`, `src/lib/milestone.ts`) but verify milestone create/archive is CLI-only, not skill-accessible. **Expected: Partial** with note about Phase 11.
14. **PROJ-11** (Phase 3): Context management → check fresh subagent spawning pattern in `skills/go/SKILL.md`, lazy loading evidence
15. **PROJ-12** (Phase 1): Framework overhead <15% → check Phase 1 context budget measurement evidence (759 chars = 3.7%)
16. **QUAL-05** (Phase 2): Quality settings configurable at init → check `src/lib/config.ts` quality section in schema, `skills/init/SKILL.md` quality prompts
17. **QUAL-07** (Phase 2): Quality config stored and respected → check `megazord.config.json` schema, config loading in execution skills
18. **CRTX-06** (Phase 2): CORTEX configurable at init → check config schema for CORTEX toggle, init skill for CORTEX option
19. **CONF-01** (Phase 2): Workflow preferences collected at init → check init skill for mode, depth, parallelization, git tracking prompts
20. **CONF-04** (Phase 2): Settings modifiable after init → check `skills/settings/SKILL.md` for post-init modification flow

For each requirement, record: requirement ID, verified status (Complete/Partial/Pending), and evidence string.

1. All 20 requirements have been individually examined (not bulk-assumed)
2. Each has a status determination backed by specific file/function evidence
3. PROJ-09 is Partial (not Complete)
4. DIST-02 and DIST-03 reflect the fixes from Plan 10-01

  <done>All 20 stale requirements individually verified with status and evidence. PROJ-09 confirmed Partial. DIST-02 and DIST-03 confirmed Complete after Plan 10-01 fixes.</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table and checkbox list</name>
  <files>.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md</files>
  <action>
Update REQUIREMENTS.md in two locations, using the verification results from Task 1:

**Location 1: Checkbox list (top of file)**

Update the 20 stale `- [ ]` markers to `- [x]` for Complete requirements. PROJ-09 stays `- [ ]` since it's Partial. The checkbox list only has two states (checked/unchecked), so Partial requirements remain unchecked.

Requirements to check off (19 of 20):
DIST-01, DIST-02, DIST-03, DIST-04, DIST-05, PROJ-01, PROJ-02, PROJ-03, PROJ-04, PROJ-05, PROJ-06, PROJ-07, PROJ-11, PROJ-12, QUAL-05, QUAL-07, CRTX-06, CONF-01, CONF-04

PROJ-09 remains unchecked (Partial).

**Location 2: Traceability table (bottom of file)**

Transform the existing 3-column table to 4-column format:
```
| Requirement | Phase | Status | Evidence |
```

Update all 20 stale Pending rows with their verified status and evidence. Also verify and update the already-marked rows (PROJ-08, PROJ-10, QUAL-01-06, CRTX-01-05, AGNT-01-08, CONF-02, CONF-03) to add evidence — these rows currently have status but no Evidence column.

**Important:** EVERY row in the traceability table gets an Evidence cell (all 42 requirements). For the 22 that already have correct status, just add evidence. For the 20 stale ones, update status AND add evidence.

Update the `Last updated` line at the bottom to reflect today's date and the requirements audit.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. No `- [ ]` markers remain for Complete requirements (only PROJ-09 unchecked)
2. Traceability table has 4 columns (header row: `| Requirement | Phase | Status | Evidence |`)
3. All 42 rows have non-empty Evidence cells with file path references
4. PROJ-09 row shows `Partial` with note about Phase 11
5. No row still shows `Pending` except if a requirement is genuinely not started
6. `Last updated` date is 2026-02-19
  </verify>
  <done>REQUIREMENTS.md fully updated: all 42 requirements have accurate status with codebase-verified evidence in 4-column traceability table, checkbox list matches, PROJ-09 correctly Partial.</done>
</task>

<verification>
1. REQUIREMENTS.md has 4-column traceability table with Evidence column
2. 19 formerly-stale requirements now show Complete with file path evidence
3. PROJ-09 shows Partial with Phase 11 note
4. DIST-02 evidence references 14 commands in commands/
5. DIST-03 evidence references package.json files array and E2E test
6. Checkbox list: only PROJ-09 remains unchecked among v1 requirements
7. All 42 requirement rows have non-empty Evidence cells

<success_criteria>
- All 20 stale Pending markers individually verified and updated
- Traceability table has 4 columns with Evidence for every requirement
- Evidence uses file path + function/section format (not line numbers, not phase names)
- PROJ-09 correctly marked as Partial
- Checkbox list consistent with traceability table
