## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

The must-haves derive from both plan frontmatter (`must_haves:` blocks in 14.1-01-PLAN.md and 14.1-02-PLAN.md).

#### Plan 01 Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Complicated+ tasks produce a CORTEX header line with domain, key signals, and frameworks being applied | VERIFIED | `CORTEX -> {domain} | {signals} | Applying: {framework list}` format present in both `skills/cortex/SKILL.md` (line 38) and `agents/mz-executor.md` (line 354) |
| 2 | Complicated+ tasks produce an Inversion pre-mortem with 3 specific failure scenarios | VERIFIED | `INVERSION (Pre-mortem)` template with "This fails when..." pattern in both files; `SKILL.md` lines 60-63, `mz-executor.md` lines 377-380 |
| 3 | Complicated+ tasks produce a Ladder of Inference assumption chain with data->interpretation->assumption->status | VERIFIED | `ASSUMPTIONS (Ladder of Inference)` with Data/Interpretation/Assumption/Status chain in both files; verified/unverified markers present |
| 4 | Complicated+ tasks produce a Second-Order Thinking consequence trace with at least 2 cascading effects | VERIFIED | `SECOND-ORDER (Consequence trace)` with First-order/Second-order/Third-order cascade in both files; "at least 2 steps" rule documented |
| 5 | Complex tasks produce a First Principles decomposition with irreducible truths before generating alternatives | VERIFIED | `FIRST-PRINCIPLES:` block in complex analysis template present in both files; decomposition method (Five Whys / Socratic Questioning) documented |
| 6 | Complex tasks produce an Abstraction Laddering WHY/HOW reframing before alternatives | VERIFIED | `ABSTRACTION-LADDERING:` with WHY/REFRAMED/HOW structure in both files; explicitly positioned before ALTERNATIVES |
| 7 | Recurring-area tasks trigger Iceberg Model with EVENT/PATTERN/STRUCTURE/MENTAL-MODEL/LEVERAGE layers | VERIFIED | `Iceberg Analysis Template` with all 5 layers in `SKILL.md` (lines 140-153); identical in executor. Trigger condition specifically requires prior SUMMARY flagging — not mere modification |
| 8 | Simple/Clear tasks produce NO visible CORTEX output | VERIFIED | `CORTEX -> Clear -- {signals}` documented as "NO visible output beyond this internal classification -- user sees nothing" in both files; Post-Classification Protocol: "Clear: Execute directly. No framework output." |
| 9 | Classification uses concrete heuristic signals (LOC, file count, APIs, modules, pattern familiarity, test coverage, side effects, external deps) | VERIFIED | 8-signal matrix present in both `SKILL.md` (lines 17-27) and `mz-executor.md` (lines 333-343); all 8 named signals confirmed |

#### Plan 02 Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Debug mode uses Issue Tree + Ishikawa cause-category decomposition for non-trivial bugs | VERIFIED | `skills/debug/SKILL.md` Step 5 contains Issue Tree template with Ishikawa software categories (Code/Data/Environment/Dependencies/Timing/State) — CORTEX-04 labeled explicitly |
| 11 | Debug mode skips formal Issue Tree decomposition when root cause is immediately obvious from stack trace | VERIFIED | "Skip formal decomposition" section with 3 specific criteria; `> Issue Tree: Skipped (root cause obvious from...)` display message present |
| 12 | Issue Tree branches use software-adapted Ishikawa categories: Code, Data, Environment, Dependencies, Timing, State | VERIFIED | Ishikawa category table in `skills/debug/SKILL.md` lines 200-210; all 6 categories present with "What to check" descriptions |
| 13 | The go orchestrator embeds CORTEX skill content in executor prompts when cortex_enabled is true | VERIFIED | `skills/go/SKILL.md` Step 2 loads `skills/cortex/SKILL.md` when `cortex_enabled = true`; `<cortex_protocol>` block in both Path A (line 272) and Path B (line 451) executor prompts; `skills/go/executor.md` pre-spawn checklist item 6 and prompt structure include `<cortex_protocol>` |

**Score:** 13/13 truths verified

### Requirements Coverage

All 5 requirement IDs are declared across both plans and verified against REQUIREMENTS.md.

| Requirement | Source Plan | REQUIREMENTS.md Description | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|-------------|------------------------------|--------|----------|
| CORTEX-01 | 14.1-01 | Enhanced challenge block — Inversion, Ladder of Inference, Second-Order Thinking for Complicated+ tasks | SATISFIED | Challenge block template in both `SKILL.md` and `mz-executor.md` with named INVERSION/ASSUMPTIONS/SECOND-ORDER frameworks; "exactly 3 failure scenarios" and "at least 2 steps" rules documented |
| CORTEX-02 | 14.1-01 | Complex domain structured brainstorm — First Principles + Abstraction Laddering replacing ad-hoc mini-brainstorm | SATISFIED | Complex analysis block in both files with FIRST-PRINCIPLES (irreducible truths + Five Whys/Socratic) and ABSTRACTION-LADDERING (WHY/REFRAMED/HOW); explicitly replaces previous ad-hoc approach (noted in executor at line 442) |

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| — | — | No TODOs, FIXMEs, placeholders found in any of the 5 affected files | — | — |

All framework templates are substantive (not fill-in-the-blank placeholders). Template placeholders like `{specific scenario 1}` are intentional instruction templates for runtime population, not implementation gaps.

---

### Human Verification Required

CORTEX is a behavioral protocol for Claude — it governs how Claude reasons through tasks, not what code executes. The core behavior of framework application cannot be verified by static analysis alone. The following items need human observation:

#### 1. Complicated Task Framework Activation

**Test:** Run `/mz:go` on a phase with a plan that modifies 3-5 files using known patterns (Complicated by signal matrix). Observe whether Claude produces a `<details>` block with CORTEX header, INVERSION pre-mortem (3 scenarios), ASSUMPTIONS chain, and SECOND-ORDER trace before executing.
**Expected:** Collapsible `<details>` block with summary line matching `CORTEX -> Complicated | {signals} | Applying: {framework list}` and all three framework sections populated with specific (not vague) content.
**Why human:** Framework output is generated at runtime by Claude reading the protocol; static analysis cannot verify that Claude follows the template correctly in practice.

#### 2. Complex Task Full Analysis Stack

**Test:** Trigger a task classified as Complex (6+ files, novel territory). Verify that BOTH challenge block AND complex analysis block appear (First Principles decomposition + Abstraction Laddering), and that Claude selects an approach with documented rationale before executing.
**Expected:** Two separate `<details>` blocks — challenge block first, complex analysis block second — with FIRST-PRINCIPLES showing irreducible truths reached via Five Whys or Socratic Questioning, and ABSTRACTION-LADDERING WHY/REFRAMED/HOW chain.
**Why human:** The quality and substantiveness of the analysis (vs. boilerplate fill-in) requires human judgment.

#### 3. Clear Task Silence

**Test:** Run a simple task (editing a comment, changing a config value). Verify no CORTEX output appears in Claude's response.
**Expected:** Zero CORTEX-related output to the user. Classification happens internally.
**Why human:** Absence of output must be observed in a live session.

#### 4. Debug Skill CORTEX-Aware Depth Control

**Test:** Run `/mz:debug` on (a) an obvious null-pointer error with clear stack trace and (b) a complex multi-module timing issue. Verify that (a) shows `> Issue Tree: Skipped (root cause obvious from...)` and proceeds directly to Fix, while (b) shows the full Issue Tree with Ishikawa categories.
**Expected:** Conditional activation works correctly — no overhead on trivial bugs, full analysis on ambiguous ones.
**Why human:** The skip/apply decision requires observing Claude's judgment on the complexity signal evaluation.

---

## Summary

Phase 14.1 goal is achieved. All 5 CORTEX requirements (CORTEX-01 through CORTEX-05) are implemented and verified against the actual codebase:

- `skills/cortex/SKILL.md` exists as a substantive 178-line authoritative protocol with all 6 framework templates, 8-signal heuristic matrix, and proper frontmatter (`disable-model-invocation: true`)
- `agents/mz-executor.md` contains the full CORTEX protocol inline (required for Task boundary compatibility), with sync comment referencing the authoritative skill file
- `skills/debug/SKILL.md` has CORTEX-aware conditional Issue Tree + Ishikawa activation with explicit skip conditions and boundary clarification
- `skills/go/SKILL.md` loads and embeds CORTEX skill content in both subagent and Agent Teams executor prompts when `cortex_enabled` is true
- `skills/go/executor.md` documents the dual-delivery pattern (flag + protocol) in pre-spawn checklist and prompt structure

All 4 commits from the plans are verified in git history (`48a9a63`, `4122957`, `38e0bf0`, `7ccf00a`). No anti-patterns detected. No regressions in executor non-CORTEX sections (Execution Flow, Commit Protocol, Pushback Mandate all intact in `mz-executor.md`).

4 items flagged for human verification — all are behavioral (runtime) checks that cannot be evaluated statically. They do not block goal achievement; they confirm runtime fidelity of the protocol implementation.
