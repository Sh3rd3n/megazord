# Phase 14.1: CORTEX Thinking Frameworks - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-20
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Enhance CORTEX from basic Cynefin classification to an adaptive reasoning engine with structured thinking protocols. CORTEX classifies every task's complexity domain (Simple/Complicated/Complex/Chaotic) and applies appropriate mental models from untools.co. This is a new capability built from scratch within the Megazord plugin — no existing CORTEX files exist in the codebase.

## Implementation Decisions

### Integration point
- Dedicated skill file: `skills/cortex/SKILL.md` with auto-trigger
- Consistent with existing Megazord pattern (all features are skills)
- No additional hooks needed — the skill activates via Claude's skill system
- All spawned agents (executor, planner, reviewer, etc.) inherit CORTEX through the plugin

### Activation behavior
- Always-on: classify every task through Cynefin, then scale response
- Simple tasks get classification only (minimal overhead), no framework output shown
- Complicated+ tasks trigger structured thinking frameworks with visible output
- No user override mechanism — Claude's classification is final

### Classification thresholds

**Claude's Discretion:** Design a combined signal heuristic that weighs multiple factors (LOC estimate, file count, new dependencies, pattern familiarity, side-effects, external system interaction). Not purely numeric — the heuristics should be concrete enough to be reproducible but flexible enough to handle edge cases. The requirement CORTEX-05 asks for "LOC ranges, module counts, API surface metrics" — include these as primary signals but allow them to be overridden by qualitative factors.

### Classification visibility
- Silent on Simple tasks — no CORTEX output shown
- Visible header on Complicated+ tasks showing: domain, key signals, frameworks being applied
- Example format: `CORTEX -> Complicated | 3 files, known pattern, 1 new interface | Applying: Inversion + Ladder of Inference`

### Thinking output format
- Detailed reasoning inside collapsible `<details>` blocks (GSD style)
- User sees only the CORTEX header; expanding reveals full framework analysis
- Claude's Discretion on exact structure per framework — some may benefit from rigid templates (Issue Tree), others from flowing analysis (First Principles)

### File artifacts
- Claude's Discretion: persist analysis to file when it adds value (likely for Complex/Chaotic tasks that produce reusable insights)

### Conditional triggers
- **Iceberg Model** (CORTEX-03): Claude's Discretion on detection mechanism for "recurring area" — may use SUMMARY.md from previous executions, git history, or contextual awareness of recently-modified areas
- **Issue Tree + Ishikawa** (CORTEX-04): Claude's Discretion on when to activate in debug mode — always-on for `/mz:debug` may be overkill for trivial bugs
- **First Principles + Abstraction Laddering** (CORTEX-02): Activated for Complex domain tasks replacing ad-hoc brainstorming

### Framework scope
- **Mandatory base (untools.co):** Inversion (pre-mortem), Ladder of Inference (assumption chain), Second-Order Thinking (consequence trace), First Principles, Abstraction Laddering, Iceberg Model, Issue Tree, Ishikawa
- **Claude's Discretion:** May complement with 5 Whys and MECE when they fit naturally (both are already partially referenced in requirements). No other additions — keep the set focused.

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Output style should feel like GSD's collapsible blocks — not intrusive, but present when you want to see the reasoning
- The "activation moment" on Complicated+ tasks should feel like CORTEX is waking up — a distinct visual break before Claude proceeds with the work
- Keep it silent on Simple tasks completely — no noise, no overhead perception

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

- Beads pattern (steveyegge/beads) integration into CORTEX — explicitly deferred to v1.2+ per REQUIREMENTS.md (CRTX-BEADS-01)
