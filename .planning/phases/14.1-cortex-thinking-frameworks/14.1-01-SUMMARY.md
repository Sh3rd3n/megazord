# Phase 14.1 Plan 01: CORTEX Thinking Frameworks Summary

**CORTEX skill with 8-signal Cynefin classification matrix and structured framework templates (Inversion, Ladder of Inference, Second-Order, First Principles, Abstraction Laddering, Iceberg Model) in collapsible output blocks**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min 39 sec
- **Started:** 2026-02-20T13:49:51Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-20T13:52:30Z
- **Tasks:** 2/2
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments

- Created `skills/cortex/SKILL.md` as the authoritative CORTEX protocol reference (178 lines) with all framework templates, classification heuristics, and anti-patterns
- Enhanced `agents/mz-executor.md` CORTEX section with full 8-signal heuristic matrix replacing the previous 4-row domain table
- Added collapsible `<details>` output format for Complicated+ tasks -- user sees only the CORTEX header line until expanded
- Added sync comment linking executor to authoritative skill file for maintenance awareness

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create CORTEX skill with full framework protocol** - `48a9a63` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Enhance executor agent with full CORTEX protocol inline** - `4122957` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `skills/cortex/SKILL.md` - Authoritative CORTEX skill definition with classification heuristic matrix, challenge block template (Inversion/Ladder of Inference/Second-Order), complex analysis template (First Principles/Abstraction Laddering), Iceberg Model template, anti-patterns, and complementary frameworks
- `agents/mz-executor.md` - CORTEX Classification section replaced with enhanced version containing 8-signal matrix, collapsible `<details>` output, named framework templates, and specific Iceberg trigger condition

## Decisions Made

- **Dual-source pattern:** CORTEX protocol duplicated inline in `agents/mz-executor.md` because @-references do not work across Task tool boundaries. The authoritative source is `skills/cortex/SKILL.md` with a sync comment in the executor. This was specified in the plan based on RESEARCH.md Pitfall 1 analysis.
- **8-signal matrix:** Replaced the compact 4-row domain table with an 8-column signal matrix (LOC, files, APIs, modules, pattern familiarity, test coverage, side effects, external deps) for reproducible classification with qualitative override capability.
- **Chaotic crisis-only rule:** Chaotic domain is only triggered by crisis signals (build broken, tests failing on unrelated code, external service down, data corruption, security incident) -- never by quantitative thresholds alone. This prevents false Chaotic classification from high LOC or many files.

## Deviations from Plan

None -- plan executed exactly as written.

## Review Findings

Code review was disabled for this execution.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None -- no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- CORTEX skill file ready for consumption by all agents via skill system
- Executor enhanced with full inline protocol for Task boundary compatibility
- Plan 14.1-02 can proceed: debug skill CORTEX-aware depth control + go orchestrator CORTEX embedding
