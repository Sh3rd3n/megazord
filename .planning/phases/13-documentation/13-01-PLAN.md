<objective>
Create a complete README.md with hero image, badges, quickstart guide, full command reference, and workflow examples that lets a new user understand, install, and start using Megazord within 5 minutes.

Purpose: This is the landing page for both the GitHub repository and the npm package page. It must communicate what Megazord is, why it exists, and how to use it -- all in a warm, conversational tone.

Output: README.md at repo root, assets/megazord-hero.svg for hero image

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create hero SVG, README structure, hero section, prerequisites, and quickstart</name>
  <files>assets/megazord-hero.svg, README.md</files>
  <action>
**Step 1: Create assets/ directory and hero SVG**

Create `assets/megazord-hero.svg` -- a clean, professional SVG badge/logo for the README header. Design requirements:
- Width ~600px, centered
- Dark background (use `#18181B` to match badge colorA)
- "Megazord" as the primary text, large and bold
- A subtitle line: generated tagline (Claude's discretion -- something like "Your development lifecycle, orchestrated" or similar, warm and concise)
- Keep it simple -- text-based SVG, no complex graphics. Think GitHub project headers like Astro or Remix.

**Step 2: Create README.md with the following sections (top half)**

Use conversational, warm tone throughout -- Remix/Astro docs style per user decision. Speak directly to the reader with "you" and "your." Explain the "why" alongside the "what."

**Section structure for this task:**

1. **Hero image** -- centered `<p align="center">` with `<img src="assets/megazord-hero.svg">`

2. **Tagline** -- one-liner centered under the hero (Claude generates this -- warm, not corporate)

3. **Badge row** -- on a single line, centered:
   - npm version: `[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/megazord-cli?style=flat&colorA=18181B&colorB=28CF8D)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/megazord-cli)`
   - CI: `[![CI](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/sh3rd3n/megazord/ci.yml?branch=master&label=CI&style=flat&colorA=18181B)](https://github.com/sh3rd3n/megazord/actions)` (placeholder URL -- will activate after Phase 14)
   - License: `[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg?style=flat&colorA=18181B)](LICENSE)`
   - Additional badges at Claude's discretion (Node.js >= 22, Claude Code, Commands: 15 are good candidates)

4. **Hero paragraph** (3-4 sentences) -- what Megazord is and why it exists. Source content from:
   - package.json description: "Claude Code framework unifying project management, code quality, and multi-agent coordination"
   - PROJECT.md core value: "One framework that handles the entire development lifecycle -- from project initialization to code delivery -- with agents that actually communicate and coordinate, not just get spawned and forgotten"
   - Unique differentiator: first framework using Claude Code's native Agent Teams for real multi-agent coordination
   - NO competitor comparisons (locked decision)

5. **Prerequisites section** -- before quickstart, per user decision:
   - [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) >= 2.x
   - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 22
   - [bun](https://bun.sh/) (any recent version)
   - Brief note on what each is/why it's needed (1 line each, warm tone)

6. **Quickstart section** -- copy-pasteable install and first-use commands:
   - Step 1: `bunx megazord-cli` (installs Megazord as a Claude Code plugin)
   - Step 2: Open Claude Code in your project directory
   - Step 3: `/mz:init` (initialize your project)
   - Step 4: `/mz:help` (see all commands)
   - Include 2-3 lines of synthetic output for `/mz:init` to show what happens
   - Claude's discretion on additional quickstart depth to match the warm, conversational tone

7. **Placeholder for remaining content** -- add a comment `<!-- Command Reference and Workflow Examples added in Task 2 -->` where the next sections will go, followed by a License section at the bottom:
   - `## License` -- MIT, link to LICENSE file
  </action>
  <verify>
- `assets/megazord-hero.svg` exists and is valid SVG (contains `<svg` opening tag)
- `README.md` exists at repo root
- README.md contains: hero image reference, badge row, hero paragraph, Prerequisites section, Quickstart section, License section
- All badge URLs use `megazord-cli` as the package name
- No competitor comparisons appear in the text
- Tone is conversational (uses "you"/"your", no corporate jargon like "leverage" or "utilize")
  </verify>
  <done>
README.md has a professional hero section with SVG image, badges, a clear hero paragraph explaining what Megazord is and why it exists, a prerequisites section listing all requirements, and a quickstart guide with copy-pasteable commands and synthetic output. A new user scrolling the GitHub page immediately understands what this is.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add command reference, workflow examples, and demo GIF placeholder</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
**Replace the Task 2 placeholder comment in README.md with the following sections.**

**Section 1: Command Reference (collapsible `<details>` section)**

CRITICAL formatting: blank line after `<summary>` and before `</details>` for markdown to render inside HTML.

Structure:
```html
<details>
<summary><strong>Command Reference</strong> -- all 15 <code>/mz:</code> commands</summary>

[content here]

</details>
```

Group commands by workflow phase (locked decision). For each command, write a mini-doc of 3-5 lines: description, usage, and when to use it.

**Setup:**
| Command | Source description |
|---------|------------------|
| `/mz:init` | Initialize a Megazord project with configuration and planning structure |
| `/mz:settings` | View and modify Megazord project configuration |
| `/mz:help` | Show all available Megazord skills with descriptions and usage examples |

**Planning:**
| Command | Source description |
|---------|------------------|
| `/mz:plan` | Plan a phase into executable tasks with dependencies and waves |
| `/mz:discuss` | Socratic brainstorming to explore approaches before implementation |
| `/mz:map` | Analyze existing codebase for brownfield project support |

**Execution:**
| Command | Source description |
|---------|------------------|
| `/mz:go` | Execute the current phase plan with subagent delegation |
| `/mz:quick` | Run a quick task without project ceremony |

**Quality:**
| Command | Source description |
|---------|------------------|
| `/mz:review` | Two-stage code review (spec compliance + code quality) |
| `/mz:verify` | Verify phase deliverables match acceptance criteria |
| `/mz:debug` | Systematic four-phase debugging (reproduce, isolate, root-cause, fix) |

**Utilities:**
| Command | Source description |
|---------|------------------|
| `/mz:status` | Show project progress, current phase, and next actions |
| `/mz:pause` | Save session context for handoff to a future session |
| `/mz:resume` | Restore context from a previous session and continue work |
| `/mz:lifecycle` | Complete milestone lifecycle: audit, archive, and next version |

For each command's mini-doc, include:
- 1-2 sentence description (warm tone, explain the "why" -- e.g., "Run `/mz:verify` to make sure your phase actually delivered what it promised, not just that tasks completed")
- Usage line (just the command, plus any common arguments if applicable)
- "When to use" line (1 sentence, concrete scenario)

**Section 2: Workflow Examples (collapsible `<details>` section)**

Same `<details>` formatting with blank lines.

Create 4 workflow examples (locked decision), each in its own sub-section inside the collapsible:

**Workflow 1: Greenfield Classic** (init -> plan -> go -> verify)
- Fictitious project: "todo-api" -- a task management API
- Scenario intro: 1-2 sentences on when/why (starting from scratch)
- Show commands + 2-3 lines synthetic output per command
- Commands: `/mz:init`, `/mz:plan 1`, `/mz:go`, `/mz:verify`

**Workflow 2: Brownfield Onboarding** (map -> plan -> go)
- Fictitious project: "my-saas" -- adding Megazord to an existing SaaS codebase
- Scenario intro: when/why (existing project, want structure)
- Commands: `/mz:map`, `/mz:plan 1`, `/mz:go`

**Workflow 3: Quick Task** (/mz:quick)
- Fictitious project: "my-app" -- adding a feature without full ceremony
- Scenario intro: when/why (small task, don't need full planning)
- Commands: `/mz:quick "Add dark mode toggle to settings page"`

**Workflow 4: Debug Workflow** (/mz:debug)
- Fictitious project: "checkout-service" -- a production bug
- Scenario intro: when/why (systematic debugging)
- Commands: `/mz:debug "Users see stale cart totals after adding items"`

Synthetic output style: plain text code blocks (no language identifier), keep output realistic but concise (2-3 lines). Reference the research examples for output format.

**Section 3: Demo GIF placeholder**

Since Megazord commands run inside Claude Code (not a standard terminal), a real demo GIF requires manual screen recording. Create a placeholder section:

```markdown
## See It in Action

<!-- TODO: Add demo GIF showing Megazord workflow in Claude Code -->
<!-- Record with: screen capture of Claude Code session running /mz:init -> /mz:plan -> /mz:go -->

> Demo coming soon -- in the meantime, install and try it yourself! The quickstart above takes under 2 minutes.
```

This placeholder is acceptable for initial publication; the real GIF can be added after the first real user session recording.

**Section 4: How It Works (brief, optional)**

Add a brief "How It Works" section (not collapsible) with 3-5 bullet points:
- 15 slash commands covering the full lifecycle
- 6 specialized agent types (executor, planner, researcher, reviewer, verifier, mapper)
- Agents coordinate via Claude Code's native Agent Teams
- 3 quality presets (strict, balanced, minimal) for different project needs
- Planning, execution, and verification are separate phases with clear handoffs

Keep this under 10 lines. Warm tone.

Ensure the License section remains at the bottom of README.md (already placed in Task 1).
