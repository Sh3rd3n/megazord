## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 8 phases derived from 42 requirements at comprehensive depth
- Roadmap: Stable primitives first (Phases 1-5), experimental Agent Teams after (Phase 6)
- Roadmap: Quality skills (Phase 7) placed after Agent Teams to leverage coordination, but designed to work with subagent fallback

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: Plugin manifest format and coexistence with other frameworks needs integration testing
- Phase 6: Agent Teams API is experimental (12 days old). Graceful degradation is the safety net.
