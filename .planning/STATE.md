# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-17)

Plan: 0 of 2 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-17 -- Phase 1 context gathered (discuss-phase)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 8 phases derived from 42 requirements at comprehensive depth
- Roadmap: Stable primitives first (Phases 1-5), experimental Agent Teams after (Phase 6)
- Roadmap: Quality skills (Phase 7) placed after Agent Teams to leverage coordination, but designed to work with subagent fallback
- Phase 1: Megazord is the successor to GSD/Superpowers — coexistence is temporary during migration
- Phase 1: `bunx megazord` = installation only; `/mz:init` = project configuration (Phase 2)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: Plugin manifest format and coexistence with other frameworks needs integration testing
- Phase 6: Agent Teams API is experimental (12 days old). Graceful degradation is the safety net.
