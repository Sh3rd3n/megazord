description: Update Megazord to the latest version
---

Update Megazord to the latest version by running the CLI update command.

Run the following command:
```bash
bunx megazord-cli@latest update
```

After the command completes, report the output to the user. The update replaces all Megazord files in `~/.claude/megazord/` with the latest version. No restart of Claude Code is needed — the updated skills and hooks take effect on the next session.
